Welcome to Fibonacci API's documentation!
=========================================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

The Fibonacci sequence is a set of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two
preceding ones. The sequence typically starts with 1 and 1. So, the first few numbers 
in the Fibonacci sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on.

Fibonacci API implements and deploys an API that calculates the n-th Fibonacci number
for a given input number n.

First of start the server on the localhost by building a docker image and run it:

    cd fibonacci_api_peoject
    docker build -t fibonacci_api .
    docker run fibonacci_api

You can now find the n-th fibonacci number by sending a request to the server:

    curl http://0.0.0.0:81/?n=7

OR

    curl http://0.0.0.0:81/iterative/?n=7

The first url finds the n-th number based on a recursive algorithm. And the seond url
works based on an iterative algorithm.


Installation
------------

Install project and run the server from source by running:

    cd fibonacci_api_peoject
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    uvicorn src.fib.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 81 --reload
