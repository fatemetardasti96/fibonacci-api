Fibonacci API
========

Fibonacci API will implement and deploy an API that calculates the n-th Fibonacci number
for a given input number n.

ðŸ“– Documentation is available at [Docs](https://fatemetardasti96.github.io/fibonacci-api/)


Start the server on your localhost by building a docker image and run it on port 81:

    cd fibonacci_api_peoject
    docker build -t fibonacci_api .
    docker run -p 81:8081 fibonacci_api

You can now find the n-th fibonacci number by sending a request to the server:

    curl http://0.0.0.0:81/?n=7

OR

    curl http://0.0.0.0:81/iterative/?n=7


Installation
------------

Install project from source by running:

    cd fibonacci_api_peoject
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    uvicorn src.fibonacci_api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 81 --reload

API Endpoints
-------------
[`GET /`] This endpoint uses the recursive algorithm to find the n-th number of the series.

[`GET /iterative`] This endpoint uses the iterative algorithm to find the n-th number of the series.
